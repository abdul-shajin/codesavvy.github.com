Hi. This is a [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)-powered blog hosted
on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) for
[zachholman.com](http://zachholman.com). Feel free to browse the source, fork,
[ask me questions](http://twitter.com/holman), and post your own compelling
blog posts.

## Your usage

Here's the deal. This is my blog, and there's certainly a distinctive look and
feel associated with it. I'd appreciate it if you changed your own fork. If
you'll notice, there's no license attached to this project, so technically I
maintain the rights associated with this project.

There's also another big reason: I use icons from
[Symbolset](http://symbolset.com) in my blog, because they are awesome. But
they're also **paid-for** icons. In other words, if you put them on your own
fork without paying for them you're illegal (and a bit of a dick, since those
guys are doing some real good work over there).

So be cool, change things up, find your own voice. It'll work better for you
in the long run, too.
